                <p>"When I founded Malakheti Vision English Boarding School, my dream was not just to build a school—but to build a future.
                     I believe that education is the most powerful tool to shape lives, families, and communities.
                      Every student who walks through our gate carries a spark, and it is our responsibility to turn
                       that spark into a shining light. I see each child not just as a learner, but as a future innovator, 
                       leader, and change-maker. My goal has always been to create an environment where students grow not 
                       only in knowledge but also in character, confidence, and compassion. The future belongs to those who
                        are prepared, and here at our school, we are preparing them—step by step—to lead it."
